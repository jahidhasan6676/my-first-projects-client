# üõçÔ∏è WearHive - E-Commerce Website


## üöÄ Project Overview

**WearHive** is a modern and dynamic full-stack e-commerce platform tailored for fashion shopping. The website supports **three user roles** ‚Äî **Customer**, **Seller**, and **Admin**, each with distinct interfaces and permissions. Additionally, a **Moderator** role is available to help manage seller-submitted products before they're published.

The platform is built with a focus on performance, security, scalability, and a great user experience. On the frontend, React and Tailwind CSS are used to deliver a clean, responsive design. The backend is powered by Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for handling APIs, authentication, and database operations. Key features include **real-time product filtering, search and sorting**, **secure payment via Stripe**, and an **AI-powered chatbot** for basic customer support and shopping guidance.

From user authentication using Firebase to JWT-secured APIs, from powerful product search filters to admin moderation capabilities ‚Äî **WearHive** combines all the essentials of a production-grade e-commerce system.
